# Audio::Playlist::JSPF

JSON representation of a 'playlist'

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanstowe/Audio-Playlist-JSPF.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanstowe/Audio-Playlist-JSPF)

## Synopsis

```perl6

use Audio::Playlist::JSPF;

my $playlist = Audio::Playlist::JSPF.from-json($some-json);

say "Playing from { $playlist.title }";

for $playlist.track -> $track {
    if $track.location.elems {
       say "Playing track { $track.title } by { $track.creator }";
       # TYpically if there is more than one location we might
       # choose the most suitable one.
       my $track-uri = $track.location.first; 
       # Do something with the track
    }
}

```

## Description

This is a JSON representation of [XSPF](http://xspf.org/) which is
a format for sharing media playlists.

Because this does the role L<JSON::Class> the objects can be created
directly from and serialised to JSON via the C<from-json> and C<to-json>
methods that role provides.

Currently there doesn't seem to be much software using this format for
playlists but JSON is convenient for a variety of reasons.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working Rakudo Perl 6 installation you should be able to
install this with *panda* :

    # From the source directory
   
    panda install .

    # Remote installation

    panda install Audio::Playlist::JSPF

This should work equally well with *zef* but I haven't tested it.
